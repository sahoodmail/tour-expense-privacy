This policy applies solely to the Android application “Tour Expense Manager”.

This Privacy Policy describes how Tour Expense Manager (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles information when you use our Android mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding data usage.
________________________________________
1. Overview
Tour Expense Manager is designed to help users track travel-related expenses. The App primarily stores data locally on your device and provides optional backup and restore functionality through your personal Google Drive account.
We do not operate our own remote servers to store your expense data.
________________________________________
2. Information We Access
2.1 Google Account Information
When you choose to sign in using Google authentication, we may access limited profile information provided by Google, which may include:
•	Name
•	Email address
•	Unique Google account identifier
This information is used solely for authentication and enabling backup/restore features.
________________________________________
2.2 User-Provided Expense Data
All expense entries, travel details, notes, and related information you create inside the App are:
•	Stored locally on your device
•	Controlled entirely by you
We do not collect or transmit your expense records to external servers owned by us.
________________________________________
2.3 Google Drive Backup Data
If you enable backup functionality:
•	The App uploads a database backup file to your personal Google Drive.
•	Backups are stored inside Google’s appDataFolder, which is private to the App.
•	We do not access, view, or retain copies of your backup files.
Your Google account storage policies and limits apply.
________________________________________
3. How Information Is Used
Information accessed by the App is used only for:
•	Secure user authentication
•	Enabling backup and restore operations
•	Maintaining app performance and functionality
We do not use your information for advertising, analytics tracking, or profiling.
________________________________________
4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell, trade, or rent personal information.
Data may be processed by trusted third-party services strictly to provide app functionality:
•	Google Sign-In (OAuth Authentication)
•	Google Drive API (Backup/Restore)
Google Sign-In and Google Drive access are used only to enable authentication and user-initiated backup features. The app does not access data unrelated to these functions.
These services operate under their own privacy policies.
________________________________________
5. Data Storage and Security
•	Primary data remains on your device.
•	Backup files remain in your personal Google Drive.
•	We implement reasonable safeguards within the App to protect information.
However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is completely secure, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

6. User Control and Data Deletion
You maintain full control over your information. You may:
•	Sign out from Google at any time
•	Delete backup files directly from Google Drive
•	Clear local app data from your device settings
