Privacy Policy — Tour Expense Manager

Effective Date: 25-02-2026 Last Updated: 25-02-2026

This policy applies solely to the Android application “Tour Expense
Manager”. This Privacy Policy explains how the app (“the App”, “we”,
“our”, or “us”) handles information when you use our mobile application.

1.  Overview Tour Expense Manager helps users track travel-related
    expenses. The App stores data locally on your device and offers
    optional backup and restore functionality using your personal Google
    Drive account. We do not operate our own remote servers to store
    your expense data.

2.  Information We Access

2.1 Google Account Information When you sign in using Google
authentication, we may access limited profile information such as your
name, email address, and Google account identifier. This information is
used only for authentication and enabling backup and restore features.

2.2 User-Provided Expense Data All expense entries, travel details, and
notes you create are stored locally on your device. We do not collect or
transmit your expense records to external servers owned by us.

2.3 Google Drive Backup Data If backup is enabled, the App uploads a
database backup file to your personal Google Drive. Backups are stored
inside Google’s appDataFolder and remain under your control. We do not
access, view, or retain copies of your backup files.

3.  How Information Is Used

-   Secure user authentication
-   Enable backup and restore operations
-   Maintain application functionality

4.  Data Sharing and Disclosure We do not sell, trade, or rent personal
    information. Data may be processed by trusted third-party services
    only to provide functionality:

-   Google Sign-In (OAuth Authentication)
-   Google Drive API (Backup and Restore)

Google Sign-In and Google Drive access are used only to enable
authentication and user-initiated backup features. The App does not
access data unrelated to these functions.

5.  Data Storage and Security Primary data remains on your device, and
    backup files remain in your personal Google Drive. While reasonable
    safeguards are implemented, no electronic storage method is
    completely secure.

6.  User Control and Data Deletion You may sign out from Google at any
    time, delete backups from your Google Drive, clear local app data
    from device settings, or uninstall the App to remove locally stored
    information.

7.  Children’s Privacy This app is not intended for children under the
    age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
    children.

8.  Changes to This Privacy Policy We may update this Privacy Policy
    periodically. Updates will be reflected by revising the “Last
    Updated” date.

10. Google Play Data Safety Disclosure No data is sold. No remote server
    storage is used. Data access is limited strictly to authentication
    and user-initiated backup functionality.

By using Tour Expense Manager, you acknowledge that you have read and
understood this Privacy Policy.
